# GeigerOS
Welcome to the repository for our self-built Geiger counter and its accompanying software. In this project, we have designed and constructed a Geiger-Muller tube-based radiation detector and developed user-friendly software for data acquisition and analysis. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for those interested in radiation detection, providing both the hardware and software components necessary to build and utilize a fully functional Geiger counter.
